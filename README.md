# The Chosen Downloader

Download episodes from The Chosen streaming platform (watch.thechosen.tv) for offline viewing.

## Why This Project?

While watching The Chosen on the official website, I experienced slow streaming speeds and constant buffering issues. The videos would frequently stutter and lag, making it difficult to enjoy the content smoothly. This frustration led me to develop a tool to download episodes for offline viewing.

I realized that others might face similar streaming problems, so I decided to open-source this project and share it with the community. Whether you have a slow internet connection, want to watch offline during travel, or simply prefer a smoother viewing experience, this tool is for you.
